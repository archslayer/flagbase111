            By accessing any part of the Flag Wars website, app, smart contracts, Discord, or related services (the &quot;Platform&quot;), including by connecting a wallet and signing the in-app consent, you agree to these Terms and to our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, do not connect a wallet and do not use the Platform.

            2. Eligibility
          </h2>
          <p style={{ marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>
            You must be at least 18 years old and legally able to use the Platform under the laws that apply to you. You confirm you are not in a prohibited location and are not a sanctioned person.

            3. Wallets and non-custodial nature
          </h2>
          <p style={{ marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>
            You use a third-party wallet to interact with the Platform. You control your keys and devices. We do not and cannot recover lost keys or assets. We do not take custody of assets and cannot reverse on-chain actions.
          </p>

          </h2>
          <p style={{ marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>
            Flag Wars runs on publicly deployed smart contracts. Actions such as buy, sell, and attack execute on-chain and are generally irreversible. If there is a conflict between the app UI and on-chain data, the blockchain state prevails. We may change game parameters, fees, UI, or features for balance, technical, or compliance reasons. Changes apply prospectively once published in the app or docs.
          </p>

          <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.5rem', fontWeight: '600', marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '1rem' }}>

          </h2>
          <p style={{ marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>
            Using blockchain involves risks. You accept risks from market volatility, price slippage, mempool behavior, reorgs, protocol changes, validator or sequencer issues, smart contract bugs, wallet failures, device compromise, phishing, and cyberattacks.
          </p>
